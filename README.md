## ðŸ’€WARNINGðŸ’€

```
Asking users to share a user token is forbidden by our Developer Policy and may result in action taken against your app and/or account. Please don't take that approach.
 
We may someday have other ways of setting presence on mobile, but for now it's really just the one method, which the game developers will need to pursue themselves if interested.
 
Thanks,
Shipwreck

# UPNP/NAT-PMP
This plugin is used to autoport port 43210 to make bombsquad game joinable from the internet for upnp/nat-pmp ready router with upnp support from their ISP.
This code uses [nat-pmp client](https://github.com/jaraco/nat-pmp) and [upnpy](https://github.com/5kyc0d3r/upnpy).
The nat-pmp module is to support modern routers and apple devices while upnpy is a fallback for all routers that dont support natpmp.
